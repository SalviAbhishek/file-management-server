Hi Abhishek,

It was nice connecting with you the other day. Apologies for getting back late. As discussed in meeting with Ashutosh, I am sharing the assignment below for us to be able to evaluate you better in terms of technical abilities required for our scheme of projects.

You can find the assignment below:

You are tasked with developing a Node.js, Express.js application that includes two essential features: Authentication and Authorization, as well as File Upload and Storage.

Authentication and Authorization:

 
-- Implement user registration functionality where users can sign up by providing these fields. (First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone No, Username, Password)
-- Develop a login system that allows registered users to log in securely using their credentials.
-- Implement JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication to protect certain routes and functionalities.
-- Implement user logout functionality.
-- Ensure proper error handling and validation throughout the authentication and authorization processes.

 

File Upload and Storage:

 

-- Provide an API endpoint to generate the token by using user credentials.
-- Provide an API endpoint that allows authenticated users by using bearer token to upload files to the server.
(Supported file types should include common formats such as images, documents, and videos)
-- Store uploaded files securely on the server with unique filenames and appropriate directories.
-- Provide an API endpoint for users to view and manage their uploaded files.
-- Provide an API endpoint for user to delete files.
-- Consider implementing a maximum file size limit and handling various file types gracefully.
-- Ensure proper error handling during file uploads and storage operations.

 

 

In Dashboard:
      - Create a feature that allows authenticated users to upload files to the server.
      - Provide a user interface for users to view and manage their uploaded files, including the ability to delete files.
      - Implement validation to ensure that only authorized users can upload files.
      - Use Redux or Context API for state management.
